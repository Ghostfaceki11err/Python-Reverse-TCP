# 🐍 Python TCP Reverse Shell (Multi-Client Support)

This repository contains my **Python TCP Reverse Shell** project — a work-in-progress tool built for **educational and ethical hacking** purposes as part of my **cybersecurity learning journey**.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This tool is intended strictly for **educational use** in controlled environments (labs, CTFs, etc).  
> Unauthorized access to systems you do not own or have permission to test is **illegal**.

## 💡 Project Overview

This project aims to implement a simple **reverse shell** over TCP using Python.  
The server can handle **multiple clients** and allows remote command execution once a connection is established.

## 🚧 Current Status

- [x] Basic TCP connection
- [x] Command execution
- [x] Multi-client connection handling
- [ ] Clean output formatting

## Planned Features:

- Multi-client support
- Basic shell command execution
- Clean interface for operator/server
- Encrypted communication (Coming Soon)
- Telegram Bot integration for C2 (Planned)
